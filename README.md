in this Java project i simulated a twitter like platform that allows users to create and manage accounts, as well as post, edit, and delete tweets.
users can like tweets, comment on them, and view detailed tweet details, including likes and comments.
The system also allows searching for accounts by username, all within the 280 character limit for tweets.
